# npurobocourse_sources

rmtt_node.py is tested in Ubuntu 20.04/ROS Noetic and used for authorized TT drones.

rmtt_node18.py is tested in Ubuntu 18.04/ROS Melodic.

Please switch in rmtt_bringup.launch.

To run rmtt_node18.py in Python 3.8:
```
pip install robomaster==0.1.1.63
pip install rospkg
pip install pyyaml
pip install scipy
```
add "-i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple" when running "pip install" in China.

In a new terminal from the workspace of npurobocourse_sources:
```
catkin_make_isolated
source devel_isolated/setup.bash
```

Connect to a TT drone by wifi, and run:
```
roslaunch rmtt_driver rmtt_bringup.launch
```

RoboMaster Tello Talent ROS Driver ([RMTT](https://github.com/tianbot/rmtt_ros)) is originally developed for [NPU-RoboCourse](https://github.com/cavayangtao/npurobocourse) through the cooperation of NPU-USRI and Tianbot. We keep the original readme below.
